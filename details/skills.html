                    <h1>Express</h1>
                    <p>For the past few projects I've gotten primarily familiar with creating Express servers, and making APIs for teams to use. I've largely been exposed to creating Node applications, and working with backend type development.</p>

                    <h1>General Stack</h1>
                    <p>Next to Express, I've worked with supplying domain names for frontend portions of applications
                    <br>
                    (setting up Apache to serve webpages, working with DNS records, and Apache virtualhosts)
                    <br> 
                    as well as setting up the backend servers on cloud instances such as Google Cloud Compute, and AWS EC2.  I've also had some smaller experiences with HTML and CSS to design webpages and documentation.

                    <p>
                        I've also worked with Python in the context of Data Science, using libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit to visualize and run statistical analyses on datasets.
