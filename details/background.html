                        I was born in Shanghai, China. Moved to the States at the age of 4, and grew up in Connecticut. Still speak somewhat conversational Cantonese, however my Mandarin has largely waned.

                        Going to NYU has been an interesting experience, however in light of the pandemic, these last 2 years have been a bit of an unfortunate experience. Given the location, it's a shame to not be able to fully take in the city more.

                        I certainly learned alot about software development, numerous aspects of computer science that are behind it, and was able to actually create some relatively substantial projects through the courses offered.

                        It deepened my passion for programming, and I hope to continue creating and learning more far into the future.

                        My high school was, at the time (unsure if they've renamed it), the Science and Technology Magnet High School of Southeastern Connecticut, which was located in New London. It was really here that gave me my first exposures to actually programming anything.
