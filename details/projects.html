                        This is was a very interesting project idea, where we looked at bankruptcy cases for companies during the pandemic. The idea was to not only see the statistics on how the pandemic affected businesses, but also to give users a way to "interact" with these statistics in the form of a Unity game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My role was to gather, clean, and serve the data on bankruptcies so the team could populate a website, and Unity environment with information on each company. Although there was a consistent issue with the quality of the data we were able to obtain, in the end I believe we achieved our initial vision for this project.

                        I had set up the Express server, and website for the team as well.

                        This was my initial first deployed personal project that really inspired a love for programming. It is a bot for Discord that allowed users some moderation, and utility commands, as well as some more casual fun commands (e.g. a magic 8ball command). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was made with the Discordjs module, and is a node application. The process of brainstorming and the learning to implement features was a huge first learning experience that has helped me approach my work even now.
